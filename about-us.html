				<p>I feel very blessed because of you. You are <br>
				a pure blessing for me from Allah. <br> When I was alone 
				and having bad time you were always there for me.<br> 
				I had some real tough time along the journey with inner me.<br>
				Sometime I was preety much unstable, But you gave me stability<br>
				in my darkest times. I really owe you for your patience, loyality,<br>
				honesty. The truth is you are a very very very special girl that<br> 
				I don't deserve but still you chosed me among thousand of boys waiting<br>
				for you in a line.I feel truly amazing because of you. You helped me to<br>
				grow and I will be grateful to you forever. In a word, we were always<br>
				together no matter what happend between us and I hope we will be together<br>
				forever. No one will be able to separate us. We have a long journey to go<br>
				together. I hope I will find you always by my side.<br>
				I love you so much Alfa! Happy Birthday my love ❤️
